"""
    For this project, you will read files formatted as follows:
    Each line represents an entity, starting robot (R), another robot (integer) or obstacle (X).
    For each robot, we indicate its position.
    Each obstacle is a rectangle: we indicate the position of its bottom left corner and its upper right corner.
    If there are constraints to the robots' movements, we indicate the possible movements between the robots by using E : (<robot1 id>, <robot2 id>)

    The robots search space is delimited by a square of side length N (N is an integer), where the positions are integers between 1 and N.
